and exits the process. What happens in case of errors in forms (syntax or runtime errors),
entering debugger and other problems is not specified. For example some lisps
just exit in case debugger is entered in batch mode, other lisps really
enter interactive debugger and hang waiting for input. The function doesn't
even allow to test exit status of the process. It is responsibility
of the lisp code in FORMS to provide handling of problematic situations
and deliver response to the parent process (e.g. by storing the result
value in a temporary file - if the temporary file is absent the parent
knows something is wrong).

If the lisp porcess does not finish in the specified TIMEOUT-SECONDS,
the process is killed together with it's possible child processes, a
LISP-PROCESS-TIMEOUT condition is signalled and the function returns NIL.

If while waiting for the process to finish it is detected that
the machive was hibernated and then woken up, HIBERNATION-DETECTED
conditon is signalled (which is not a SERIOUS-CONDITION subclass),
and the hibernation duration is excluded from the time accounted
for the timeout.

If the calller thinks the hibernation may affect the results
of the lisp process (e.g. because network connections
were terminated) he can handle the HIBERNATION-DETECTED
condition; for example by running the process again.
Otherwise he may just ignore the condition."))
