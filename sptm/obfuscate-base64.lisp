;;;; This module implements obfuscation of base64 striing so it doesn't look
;;;; base64. The motivation is to avoid AWS credentials search by pattern
;;;; (a regex, for example) if you need to publish them, but don't 
;;;; want to draw attention to that.
;;;;
;;;; The obfuscated form looks like a sentence - space separated "words",
;;;; i.e. short sequences of lower case latin caracters.
;;;;
;;;; The 23 latin charactes form a kind of base23 encoding.
;;;; But in our implementation it is a variable length encoding -
;;;; some base64 characters translate to 1 output character,
;;;; some to 2 characters.
;;;;
;;;; Each base64 character is first mapped to its index in the
;;;; base64 alphabet (from 0 to 63). Then this index is printed
;;;; in our variable length base23 encoding.
;;;;
;;;; Which is:
;;;; - only needs to represent numbers between 0 and 63
;;;; - the first 3 latin characters are used for the optional
;;;;   most significant position in the representation:
;;;;   a = 20, b = 40, c = 60
;;;; - the remaining 20 latin caracters are used for the
;;;;   least significant position, and represent numvers
;;;;   from 0 to 19.
;;;;
;;;; So base64 character `F` is at the position 5 (zero based)
;;;; in the base64 alphabet, it is represented by the
;;;; character `i` which has position 5 between the last 20 latin
;;;; characters.
;;;;
;;;; Base64 character 'm' is represented as `ay' where 'a' stands
;;;; for 20 and 'y' stands for 18.
;;;;
;;;; At the end, spaces inserted into encoded string, at random
;;;; places, in avearate after every 5 characters.
