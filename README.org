* The Goal
  Improve stability of the Common Lisp ecosystem
  by performing automated tests on as wide set of 
  environments as possible. Environments vary
  mainly in 3 dimensions:

  1. Common Lisp implementations. They have incompatibilities,
     sometimes allowed by the standard (features specified
     as implementation-dependent), sometimes due to bugs,
     and sometimes in non-standardized features (threading,
     sockets, FFI, etc.). Moreover, implementations are
     evolving over the time, we should care about different
     versions of the same implementation.
  2. Growing number of CL libraries (which are also evolving 
     over the time).
  3. Compatibility between library versions - libraries
     depend on other libraries and work correctly
     only with particular versions of the dependencies.
 
  Therefore, when we run test suite of some library, we can speak 
  about success or failure only in context of given Common Lisp 
  implementation, and versions of all the dependency libraries.
  
  Lets call the set of libraries with specified versions a "lib-world".  
  Important example of lib-world are Quicklisp distros.
  
  It is hoped that constantly running tests on wide variety 
  of environments will help the CL community by:
  
  1. Fast response to the library authors in case new
     changes cause bugs on implementations not available
     to the author. Otherwise author may receive notification
     about the bug years after he made the change, and 
     thus the cost of fixing the bug may be much higher than
     fixing it week or two after the change.
  2. The same benefit for CL implementors - when they
     release new version, run test suites of large
     number of libraries and quickly detect
     possible regressions in the new release.
  3. Help to discover and maintain compatible
     set of library versions (e.g. Quicklisp distros).

  Limitations.

  Test suite success does not always mean the library is workable -
  there might be bugs which are not covered by the tests.
  
  And the other way around - failed tests not always
  means the library is broken - it may be just 
  a bug in the tests themselves. 

  Reducing this gap increases the utility of automated testing.

* The Implementation Idea
  Everyone can run a simple command which will run tests 
  of Common Lisp libraries and publishes results
  online.

  That way, instead of setting up a central build farm with 
  all the possible hardware/OS/Lisp implementation combinations,
  we provide a way for Common Lisp users to contribute
  test results from their systems, and collectively
  monitor the CL world. (Of course, if anyone would want
  to setup a test farm, cl-test-grid simplifies this task too,
  by providing required building blocks).

* Status
  We provide tools to:
  - run tests
  - publish results online and access them programmatically
  - perform massive comparison of results and print HTML
    reports. For example, compare results of two Quicklisp
    versions, or compare two versions a lisp implementation
    on the same Quicklisp.

  The tests are run by a lisp program called =test-grid-agent=.
  User configures it with a list of CL implementations installed
  on his machine, and =test-grid-agent= runs tests of common lisp
  libraries on these implementations.

  The tests performed by agent include:
  - fresh recompilation and loading of every ASDF system found in Quicklisp;
  - testsuites of some of the libraries.

  For testsuites we have so far considered 122 libraries,
  starting from more often downloaded ones.
  67 of these libraries have appropriate test suites
  (fully automated, no user interaction is needed) which
  are added to the cl-test-grid.
  
  The test results represented as lisp data are stored online
  in so called =test-grid-storage=. By default =test-grid-storage=
  named "main" is where the test results are published.

  You may also choose other storage name if you want to do some private
  testing and don't want to mix your results with "main" results.
  The use cases for this are pre-release testing of CL implementations,
  ASDF, or patches to particular libraries.

  The =test-grid-storage= named "main" is intended to contain results
  for the last 3 Quicklisp distros and is cleared periodically.
  Old results are archived in a plain lisp files in a separate git repository:
  https://github.com/cl-test-grid/cl-test-grid-results.

  Besides this, we store online the output produced by
  each lisp process running test suites or compiling ASDF systems.
  The logs are referenced from the test results lisp data.
  This allows interested parties to navigate to the corresponding
  log to study the failure details.

  Some HTML reports are demonstrated above, in the Test Results
  section. More information about reporting may be found
  in the =test-gird-reporting= module documentation.

  The issue tracker at https://bugs.launchpad.net/common-lisp/
  is used to record the bugs we submitted to various CL projects.
  We record bugs there to avoid duplicated bug reports.

  cl-test-grid consists of the following components:
  - [[/agent][test-grid-agent]] - the program able to run tests and upload the results online.
  - [[/testsuites][test-grid-testsuites]] - testgrid adapters for testsuites of all the included
    libraries; used by agent.
  - [[/storage][test-grid-storage]] - online storage for test results (Lisp data). Based on =sptm=
  - [[/sptm][sptm]] - simple in-memory persistence for lisp data based on transaction log
    stored online at Amazon Web Services.
  - [[/gae-blobstore][test-grid-gae-blobstore]] - online storage for test logs (plain text files).
    Runs on Google App Engine.
  - [[/reporting][test-grid-reporting]] - tools to generate reports from test results.
  - [[/data][test-grid-data]] - support code for test results datastructures shared between other
    components; =data= is produced by =agent=, stored in =storage= and used by =reporting=
  - [[/server][test-grid-server]] - tiny web application running at Heroku which forwards 
    notification from =agents= to the cl-test-grid-notifications google group.
  - [[/utils][test-grid-utils]] - utilities.

  The packages also have nicknames prefixed with =tg-= : =tg-agent=, =tg-testsuites=, and so on.

  More detailed documentation for most of the modules may be found in the module subdirectory.

* Participation
** Running tests
   Described in the =agent= module documentation.

   We are looking for contributors who would agree to run
   =test-grid-agent= periodically (ideally once a day, but even
   once a month is OK).

** Adding testsuite of your library

   It's necessary to contact the cl-test-grid mailing list
   and add a method for the =libtest= generic function to this file:
   [[https://github.com/cl-test-grid/cl-test-grid/blob/master/testsuites/testsuites.lisp][testsuites/testsuites.lisp]]. The =libtest= function converts
   results of library test suite to a unified format
   understood by test-grid.

   If you use some of the popular CL test frameworks,
   the implementation is usually simple, like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
   (defmethod libtest ((library-name (eql :cl-containers)))
     ;; The test framework used: lift.
     (quicklisp:quickload :cl-containers-test)
     (run-lift-test-suite :cl-containers-test))
   #+END_SRC
   
   If you are not the library author and don't know how
   its test suite is run, look how the library tests are
   started in the =asdf:perform= method for =asdf:test-op=
   defined in the library .asd file.

   In any case, contact the mailing list, we will help.
